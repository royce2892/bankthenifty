Hi, This is a minor data analysis of Nitfy 50 data from the past 20 years till Feb 26 2020.
I have tried to calculate % changes weekly, monthly, daily, friday to thursday, monday to thursday, wednesday to thursday and friday to thursday.
I believe this can help us to make better option expiry calls and puts writing.
This is by no means an exhaustive study, so be careful if you use the results for trading

Results can be found in the results.txt page
