  Hi, This is a minor data analysis of Nitfy 50 data from the past 20 years till Feb 26 2020.<br>
  I have tried to calculate percentage changes weekly, monthly, daily, friday to thursday, monday to thursday, wednesday to thursday and friday to thursday.<br>
  I believe this can help us to make better option expiry calls and puts writing.<br>
  This is by no means an exhaustive study, so be careful if you use the results for trading<br><br>

  Results can also be found in the results.txt page<br><br>
